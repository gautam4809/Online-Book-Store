# Online Book Store - Java GUI Application

## About
This project is a Java-based Online Book Store application with a graphical user interface built using Swing. It allows users to register, login, browse/search available books, add books to a shopping cart, place orders, and for admins to manage book inventory.

The application demonstrates core Java programming concepts including:
- Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
- GUI development with Swing
- List and collection management for book and user data
- Basic user authentication and session management

## Features
- User registration and login
- Display of available book stock after login
- Book search by title or author
- Add/remove books to/from a shopping cart
- Order placement and order history viewing
- Admin panel for adding, updating, and deleting books

## Sample Credentials for Quick Start

| Username | Password |
|----------|----------|
| user     | 1234     |

You can also register new users via the Register interface.
